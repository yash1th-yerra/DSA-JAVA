bit prerequisites for tries:

   1.
   
    Bit manipulation in tries are quite different.
    why?
    
    simple if we i ask binary number of 9 then you'll say 1001 but when we are working with tries you can't say it 1001
    because computer stores those numbers in either 32bits or 64 bits
    its index moving from right to left
    
   2.
    
    Xor operator
    1^0 = 1
    0^1 = 1
    1^1 = 0
    0^0 = 0
    
    xor on even number of same number is 0
    Xor on odd number of same number is 1
    
    how to check if bit is set or not?
    
    shift 1 by ith positions and do & operation between binary and shifted one .
    000.......1001 | 000.......0010 
    if result is 0 it is not set else it is set
    
    how do you turn on a bit?
    
    like given 9 as number and i want you to turn 2nd index bit from right side i.e. turn 0 into 1
    000......1001 is binary of 9 
    so using 1 and shift it to nth index positions in this case it is 2 and then do or operation between shifted one and original number i.e.9
    
     000.......1001 | 000.......0010 = 000......1011
