MultiThreading
---------------------------
What is multithreading and why multithreading is required?

1. In single threading environment , only task can be performed at a time.
2. it wastes cpu cycles
3. In MultiThreading environment , it allows different parts of code to be executed cocurrently
to increase max utilization of cpu

Thread vs Process
----------------------------
Process -> single contained execution unit which runs program independently in its owns resources and execution environment
Thread -> smallest unit of execution or light weight process , executes some part like a method of program
            even though they share common resources it executes tasks indepedently
            i.e. each thread has its own execution flow


Main Thread
----------------------------
1. This is the thread that executed when an application is run i.e. main method is called
2. if no child or user thread are spawned , the program terminates when main() method finishes executing
3. if child are spawned , the program will keep running until all threads haver completed . but main will not wait to finish it can finish anytime
4. runtime will distinguish between main and daemon threads


Thread creation
-------------------------
1. implementing java.lang.Runnable interface
2. extending java.lang.Thread class

What is the difference in creating thread using runnable or thread classes
