Heap Data Structure:

     - Heap is a complete binary tree based data structure where it satisfies heap propertry:
       for every node , its children's values should be greater or equal to its own value
     - it is generally used to implement priority queues where the smallest or largest element
       always at the root of tree making finding largest or smallest element in O(1)
     - Heaps are two types min heap or max heap
     tips:
     if question contains kth smallest - you build max heap
     if question contains kth largest  - you build min heap

    MinHeap:

                   2
                 /   \
               3      4
             /  \    /
           7    6  5



    MaxHeap:


               15
             /    \
           10      8
         /   \    /
       7     5  6
