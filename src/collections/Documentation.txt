Collections Framework
------------------------------------------

Collection is an interface that extends iterable interface
that specifies an iterator to sequentially access the elements of an iterable object


Iterable -> object(impl)
object sequential accessible

Collections -> iterable (iteration impl)

Collections (interface) -> Object (impl iteration)

Iterable -> Collections -> List/Set/Queue (interface hierarchy)



Arraylist
---------------
1. dynamic
2. used when size of array is not known before compiling
3. uses normal array , set to default cap . cap increases based on limit reach
4. how? just creates new array including growth size and copies all elements into it
5. old array can be garbage collected eventually

Vector
------------------
Same as arraylist but just thread safe (slower compared to arraylist)


LinkedList
------------------------
1. implents using doubly linkedlist
2. faster insertion and deletion
